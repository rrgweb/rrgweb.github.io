Latest News 
19/1/16:
Site visit by G0UWS and G6REG: Following numerous requests from our users we have switched over to CC3 and connected to their CBRIDGE today. GB7TC is now fully operational with UK and World-wide talkgroups.  Connection and coverage tests have provided excellent results. We now have a seamless connection from Newbury to Bristol on the M4. Thank you to all those who called in to provide reports and positive comments. 

29/12/15:
Site visit by G0UWS and G0BEQ to install 3G router and aerial. Connection made between GB7TC and the SWC master base GB7BS. After some tweaking of the APN settings on the 3G router cluster connection was achieved. Traffic is now flowing from SW Cluster connected repeaters to TC on TS2 TG950


17/10/15:
Site visit today with G4XUT, G8VRI, G0UWS and myself: The combiner system was installed and aligned and tested today to allow GB3TD and GB7TC to co-reside on the same aerial. The photograph below shows the diplexers, band-pass filters and circulator. In addition three 20dB admiralty notch filters were deployed to isolate TC transmit from TD receive. Isolation is now over 70dB. GB3TC is transmitting full legal ERP from the stacked dipole on the tower.





Currently GB7TC (Motorola SLR5500) is housed in a temporary rack with the new combiner system. The DMR repeater is running in Local mode for testing with both timeslots active but no IP site interconnect yet. See photograph below (the PYE transmitter & receiver are the not connected):




The DMR base station (see above photograph) is sitting temporarily ontop of the rack. The diplexer and other combining equipment take up 9U at the bottom of the rack. - Andy G6REG
