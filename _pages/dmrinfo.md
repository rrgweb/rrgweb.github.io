MONITORING THE DMR NETWORK
Local monitoring of GB7TC
This shows who is using GB7TC, by following links you can monitor an individual call sign or switch to other DMR repeaters.

http://www.opendmr.net/monitor.php?filter=rpt&rptid=235250
Monitoring the UK DMR network
This show the status of the UK (and some Dutch) DMR repeaters, also the traffic on the links to Wires and Brandmeister networks.

http://phoenix-k.opendmr.net/ipsc/

I use it to monitor and also see who is active!
Checking the internet link from GB7TC
If you use the echo TG9990 and it fails to echo audio, then the link is down or there is a core issue. In most cases this will resolve within a few minutes as the link from GB7TC to the internet uses 3G technology and it re-initializes occasionally.

GPS TO APRS
For those getting to grips with GPS to APRS. There are a few different private talk groups you can send the data to which produce different behaviour on APRS.

RRS & Radio IDs:
5050 = without SSID
5055 = House QTH
5056 = Camping
5057 = walking with handheld radio
5058 = boat
5059 = car

Please see http://www.opendmr.net/index.php/anytone-d868uv-gps/ for set-up and configuration details.

TYT MD380
The Tytera MD380 DMR/FM handportable has become popular with a lot of radio amateurs. The latest code plug with GB7TC included can be downloaded here md380-rt3-swindon.rdt
At a cost of less than Â£80 it has proven to be a useful entry to DMR with good audio reproduction, easy programming, great battery life and a solid construction. The only downside seems to be the poor selectivity in the receiver front end. All in all a great starter radio.

USING RF POWER AMPLIFIERS WITH DMR TRANSCIEVERS
The general concensus is 'DON'T!' The switching speed and rise/fall time requirements for TDMA far outstrip the capabilities of most external RF (linear) Power Amplifiers. For more information see link: .Linear Amplifiers and DMR.pdf
