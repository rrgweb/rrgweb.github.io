#### MONITORING THE DMR NETWORK

##### Local monitoring of GB7TC
This shows who is using GB7TC, by following links you can monitor an individual call sign or switch to other DMR repeaters.

[http://www.dmr-uk.net/monitor.php?filter=rpt&rptid=235250](http://www.dmr-uk.net/monitor.php?filter=rpt&rptid=235250)

##### Monitoring the UK DMR network

##### Checking the internet link from GB7TC

If you use the echo TG9990 and it fails to echo audio, then the link is down or there is a core issue. In most cases this will resolve within a few minutes as the link from GB7TC to the internet uses 3G technology and it re-initializes occasionally.

#### GPS TO APRS
For those getting to grips with GPS to APRS. There are a few different private talk groups you can send the data to which produce different behaviour on APRS.  

|RRS & Radio IDs| |
|---|---|
|5050|without SSID|
|5055|House QTH|
|5056|Camping|
|5057|Walking with handheld radio|
|5058|Boat|
|5059|Car|

#### TYT MD380
The Tytera MD380 DMR/FM handportable has become popular with a lot of radio amateurs. The latest code plug with GB7TC included can be downloaded here [md380-rt3-swindon.rdt]({{ site.url }}/assets/codeplugs/md380-rt3-swindon.rdt)

At a cost of less than Â£80 it has proven to be a useful entry to DMR with good audio reproduction, easy programming, great battery life and a solid construction. The only downside seems to be the poor selectivity in the receiver front end. All in all a great starter radio.

#### USING RF POWER AMPLIFIERS WITH DMR TRANSCIEVERS
The general concensus is 'DON'T!' The switching speed and rise/fall time requirements for TDMA far outstrip the capabilities of most external RF (linear) Power Amplifiers.
