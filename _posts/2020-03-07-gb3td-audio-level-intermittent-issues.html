Over the past few days it has been observed that the audio level on TD can, on occasions be much lower than it should. Please do NOT adjust your radios or think that your deviation level is wrong as its more likely the repeater.<br /><br />We are trying to identify the issue but like most intermittent faults its not aways happening when you investigate. We "think" it happens more often when the TX radio gets warm but this is yet to be confirmed.<br /><br />Please bare with us whilst we attempt to resolve this matter.<br /><br />
