<br /><h2><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: blue;">GB3TD - Wide-split, Dual-mode analogue / digital - what next?</span></span></h2>The repeater group have been wrestling with a number of problems and potential enhancements with GB3TD over the past few years.<br /><br />We have a first class site but do suffer some local (off-site) interference caused by an as yet unidentified digital pulse transmission at certain times of the day.<br /><br />We are also a key UHF repeater on the M4 corridor and much further afield.<br /><br />Our two neighboring repeater groups in&nbsp; Bristol and Reading are opting for Dual-mode DMR based on the professional TDMA standard (Mototrbo) but still retaining a conventional analogue option. TDMA DMR would offer us two digital frequencies running simultaneously (well almost! - different time-slots), with one possibly used for local working and the second for interlinking to other repeaters or/and Echolink. <br /><br />We are also considering moving to wide-split (7.6MHz) operation which would increase the receive coverage reducing current combining losses (swapping cavities for a diplexer) and move our output frequency away from the current localised digital interference. We may also have the option of unattended Echolink similar to some wide-split UHF repeaters.&nbsp; <br /><br />We would welcome any comments from users or interested parties as to their thoughts on both options or any experiences you may have.<br /><br />Many thanks<br /><br />73's<br /><br />Andy G6REG
