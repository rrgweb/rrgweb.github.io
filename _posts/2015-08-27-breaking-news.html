<strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: small;">The Group's Committee met last night &amp; a decision was reached concerning a&nbsp;DMR repeater,&nbsp;at the moment&nbsp;Nigel G8VRI has volunteered to apply for the NoV &amp; this is now underway, &nbsp;hopefully the application will go through without opposition. The callsign for the new repeater will be either GB7TC (1st choice)&nbsp;or GB7QJ (2nd choice). Onsite evaluation tests, purchase of equipment, etc. to come,&nbsp;more updates later as stages are completed.</span></span></strong>
