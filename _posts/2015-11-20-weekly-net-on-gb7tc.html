Tim M6XTB is trying to get a weekly NET running on GB7TC on a Tuesday between 20:00 - 22:00 &amp; again on Thursday between 20:00 - 21:00.<br /><br />If you have a DMR radio please try and call in, the NET will be on GB7TC Slot 2 TG9<br /><br />We hope that other non DMR repeaters will also have a NET running over the coming months.<br /><br /><br />
