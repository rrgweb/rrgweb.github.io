<strong><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Those of you who listen to WH will realise that we have made some changes as of&nbsp;yesterday.<br /><br />The Repeater is now back on the correct metered supply with a new UPS in circuit following the&nbsp;site owner's&nbsp;repairs to the electrical circuit. They have also fixed the door, lock etc.&nbsp; so the room is now secure.<br /><br />The close down call sign has been removed as agreed some while ago. Hence the only ID is now the beacon.<br /><br />One of the issues when the repeater was not on its' "normal" supply was that we had a double P at the end and at first we could not understand why. A look through the logic commands revealed the answer although a bit of thought would have told us.<br />When on normal supply at the end of the over we had two&nbsp; E's. Well the parameter that drives this is the same one that drives the P.<br /><br />So on a whim really I decided to go for a "single" only and as E is a bit short, needed to choose something else. K was the obvious one but TD has that and as some folk monitor both at the same time I plumped for R. <br /><br />Thanks to Andy, G0UWS for help today.<br /><br />Tony G4LDL</span></strong>
