<h2><b><span style="color: red;">Fantastic news N.o.V approved!!!</span></b></h2><br />Following the meeting of the DMR Engineering Working Group on 9th September we received news that the NoV submitted by Nigel G8VRI last month was approved by RA on 10th September. The new repeater will be co-located with GB3TD, our existing UHF analogue repeater.<br /><br /><br />We are now in negotiations for the supply and commissioning of a Motorola SLR5500 MotoTRBO DMR base station which will eventually become part of the South West Cluster on Timeslot 2, with Timeslot 1 being reserved for local traffic and other services. <br /><br />Please watch this space for more updates<br /><br />73s all<br /><br />Andy G6REG
