<div><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A slight modification was carried out on the GB3TD logic on the 13th  February 2016.</span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The CTCSS (118.8hz) on time from the repeater after carrier drop is now set  at 1 second and this means that on most radios if CTCSS (DEC) decode has been  set, you will not hear the “K”.</span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The “K “ is still there but not with 118.8Hz sub audible tone on the  carrier.</span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Some radios i.e Baofeng’s and some Yeasu’s have a different type of CTCSS  decode system and therefore you may still hear the “K” even with CTCSS (DEC)  decode on.</span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The reason we have made the change is to prevent the courtesy tone being  transmitted on Echolink which also speeds up the handover time.</span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The change is a trial and will be reviewed at the next committee meeting in  March.</span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /></span></strong></div><div><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Rob G4XUT</span></strong></div>
