GB3TD Frequency Change
----------------------

Due to the continued interference from unknown sources for over several years, 
the RRG decided to apply for a change of frequency. A change of frequency was attempted
in 2019 but due to external circumstances the RRG agreed to revert back to RB03. 

The new NOV has now been issued so we will now agree a date for changing the filters
and radio programming to move the repeater frequencies to UR63 TX 438.3875Mhz and RX 430.7875Mhz.
We will give everyone plenty of advance notice to alter their radios in time for the change!
