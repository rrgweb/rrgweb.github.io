We are aware of an issue with GB3WH, it appears that the output power has dropped off significantly.<br /><br />We have recived approval from the site owners to attend site on Sunday and will do what we can to restore service.<br /><br />17/09/17 - Update, WH has now been removed from site and is <u><b>off-air</b></u> for the time being whilst investigations are made into its low output. <br /><br />20/11/17 - WH is now back running again. We welcome feedback.<br /><br />Andy G0UWS
