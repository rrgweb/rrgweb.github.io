Andy G6REG and Rob G4XUT were on the GB3TD site on 31st December changing over the base station units for GB3TD after there had been problems with an intermittent transmit failure.<br /><br />Since then, things have been working well - although Rob mentions that they might need to tweak the &nbsp;audio level a bit.<br /><br />Thanks Rob and Andy for taking care of the transmit failure.
