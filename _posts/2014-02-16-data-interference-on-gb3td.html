If you're a GB3TD user you may have noticed some data interference on the output of the repeater. Some investigation is being made and some beam headings have been taken.<br /><br />However there also seems to be a wider issue with GB3UB and GB3VS also experiencing problems of the same nature.<br /><br />If you know anything more, please let us know!
